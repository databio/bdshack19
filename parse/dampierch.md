# sciCAR Dataset Parser

Start in `/sfs/lustre/allocations/shefflab/bdshack19/sciCAR`.

## Raw Data

Find raw data in `/sfs/lustre/allocations/shefflab/bdshack19/sciCAR/rawdata`.

### Explore

I start with `awk` because I know how to use it. I want to learn how to do this in `Python`.

First two lines of `GSM3271044_RNA_mouse_kidney_cell.txt.gz`:

    $fn=GSM3271044_RNA_mouse_kidney_cell.txt.gz
    $zcat ${fn} | awk -v FS="," 'NR<3 {print $0}'

    sample,source,replicate,experiment,tsne_1,tsne_2,cell_name
    coRNA-RNA-plate1-001.TCGGCGTCGT,Mouse,Replicate 1,coassay,NA,NA,NA

To see all the sample_ids and their frequency:

    zcat ${fn} | awk -v FS="," '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | less

__To find # fields in each file:__

    files=`find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.txt.gz" | awk -v FS='/' '{print $2}'`
    for i in $files; do zcat $i | awk -v FS=',' -v n=$i 'NR==1 {print NF,n}' >> fields.txt; done

    zcat ${fn} | awk -v FS="," 'NR>1 {print $1}' | sort > atac_sample_id.txt

__Overlap:__

    awk 'NR==FNR {a[$0]; next} {for (i in a) if ($1==i) print $0}' rna_sample_id.txt atac_sample_id.txt

11,296 cells in both datasets
