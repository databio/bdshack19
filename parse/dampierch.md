# sciCAR Dataset Parser

Start in `/sfs/lustre/allocations/shefflab/bdshack19/sciCAR`.

## Raw Data

Find raw data in `/sfs/lustre/allocations/shefflab/bdshack19/sciCAR/rawdata`.

### Explore

I start with `awk` because I know how to use it. I want to learn how to do this in `Python`.

First two lines of `GSM3271044_RNA_mouse_kidney_cell.txt.gz`:

    $fn=GSM3271044_RNA_mouse_kidney_cell.txt.gz
    $zcat ${fn} | awk -v FS="," 'NR<3 {print $0}'

    sample,source,replicate,experiment,tsne_1,tsne_2,cell_name
    coRNA-RNA-plate1-001.TCGGCGTCGT,Mouse,Replicate 1,coassay,NA,NA,NA

To see all the sample_ids and their frequency:

    zcat ${fn} | awk -v FS="," 'NR>1 {print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | less

__To find # fields in each file:__

    files=`find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.txt.gz" | awk -v FS='/' '{print $2}'`
    for i in $files; do zcat $i | awk -v FS=',' -v n=$i 'NR==1 {print NF,n}' >> fields.txt; done

### Key fields

For `GSM3271044_RNA_mouse_kidney_cell.txt.gz`:

    fn=GSM3271044_RNA_mouse_kidney_cell.txt.gz

$1,$3,$7::sample,replicate,cell_name

*sample*

    zcat ${fn} | awk -v FS="," 'NR>1 {print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c

__13,893__ sample_ids

*replicate*

    zcat ${fn} | awk -v FS="," 'NR>1 {print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | less

__6,969__ Replicate 1
__6,924__ Replicate 2

*cell_name*

    zcat ${fn} | awk -v FS="," 'NR>1 {print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | less | wc -l

__15__ cell types (including NA)

For `GSM3271045_ATAC_mouse_kidney_cell.txt.gz`:

    fn=GSM3271045_ATAC_mouse_kidney_cell.txt.gz

$1,$2::sample,replicate

*sample*

    zcat ${fn} | awk -v FS="," 'NR>1 {print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c

__13,395__ sample_ids

*replicate*

    zcat ${fn} | awk -v FS="," 'NR>1 {print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | less

__7,049__ Replicate 1
__6,346__ Replicate 2

### Cell annotations

#### From RNA-seq

    fn=GSM3271044_RNA_mouse_kidney_cell.txt.gz
    zcat ${fn} | awk -v FS="," 'NR>1 {print $1}' | sort > rna_sample_id.txt

#### From ATAC-seq

    fn=GSM3271045_ATAC_mouse_kidney_cell.txt.gz
    zcat ${fn} | awk -v FS="," 'NR>1 {print $1}' | sort > atac_sample_id.txt

#### Overlap

    awk 'NR==FNR {a[$0]; next} {for (i in a) if ($1==i) print $0}' rna_sample_id.txt atac_sample_id.txt

__11,296__ cells in both datasets

Cassie's version is way faster:

    awk -v file=${DATA}/GSM3271044_RNA_mouse_kidney_cell.txt 'BEGIN {FS=","; while (getline<file) {a[$1]=1}} NR>1 && $1 in a {print $1}' ${DATA}/GSM3271045_ATAC_mouse_kidney_cell.txt > matching.txt

I modify my code to be faster:

    awk -v FS="," 'NR==FNR {a[$1]; next} {if ($1 in a) print $1}' GSM3271040_RNA_sciCAR_A549_cell.txt GSM3271041_ATAC_sciCAR_A549_cell.txt | wc -l

#### Unique to RNA set

    awk -v FS="," 'NR==FNR {a[$1]; next} {if (!($1 in a)) print $1}' GSM3271041_ATAC_sciCAR_A549_cell.txt GSM3271040_RNA_sciCAR_A549_cell.txt | wc -l

__1,268__ cells only in RNA set

*I think this number is incorrect, because total RNA ids minus total overlap ids is 2597. Something is missing. I will ignore this for now because it's irrelevant to larger project.*

#### Unique to ATAC set

    awk -v FS="," 'NR==FNR {a[$1]; next} {if (!($1 in a)) print $1}' GSM3271040_RNA_sciCAR_A549_cell.txt GSM3271041_ATAC_sciCAR_A549_cell.txt | wc -l

__1,260__ cells only in ATAC set

*I think this number is incorrect, because total ATAC ids minus total overlap ids is 2099. Something is missing. I will ignore this for now because it's irrelevant to larger project.*
